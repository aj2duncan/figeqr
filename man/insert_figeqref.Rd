\description{
Invoke RStudio add-in to help insert either equation or figure references
}
\details{
It is assummed that this addin will be called whilst the focus of
    RStudio is an R markdown document that will allow users to insert
    references - for example a Bookdown document.

    It will search the R markdown document and collect all chunk names and
    equation references. The user can then choose what to insert.

    When the user has chosen what to insert, they should click Done. The
    reference, including required syntax will be inserted at the cursor
    position.
